# notouch-dispenser
Imagine a daily life with notouch objects interaction.
-Project Example-
Arduino file to make your own DIY soap/hydroalcohol dispenser gel. Ultrasonic HC-SR04 or Gesture APDS 9960 sensors based. This last uses ONLY a 3.3V voltage. If NOT, you'll damage your board. Be careful.

Languages: English, Spanish.

**ESSENTIAL TO READ: **
This repository was maked for the hard global situation about the Covid-19 propagation planetary.
It includes the .ino file to upload in your arduino board.
The specific primary pines to build de project are:

- EMITTER PIN HC-SR04-->5
- RECEIVER PIN HC-SR04-->6
- VCC-->5v
- GND-->GND
- MICRO SERVO SG90 1
    VCC-->VCC             The best power supply used for the servos is an external battery 5-6V being 6V the perfect voltage.
    GND--GND
    SIG-->9
- MICRO SERVO SG90 2
    VCC-->VCC             The best power supply used for the servos is an external battery 5-6V being 6V the perfect voltage.
    GND--GND
    SIG-->10

CASE OF GESTURE SENSOR APDS9600:
- GND-->GND
- VCC-->3.3v
- SDA-->A4
- SCL-->A5
- INT-->D2
- MICRO SERVO SG90 1
    VCC-->VCC             The best power supply used for the servos is an external battery 5-6V being 6V the perfect voltage.
    GND--GND
    SIG-->9
- MICRO SERVO SG90 2
    VCC-->VCC             The best power supply used for the servos is an external battery 5-6V being 6V the perfect voltage.
    GND--GND
    SIG-->10

just send me a email, it is inside bio. I'll send it for free.

REALLY YOU CAN USE THIS CODE ARCHITECTURE TO DIY ANY KIND OF PROJECT TO AUTOMATE A LOT OF THINGS JUST
MODIFYING IT A LITTLE BIT. THIS PROJECT IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE OF IT ORIENTED TO THE FREQUENTLY USE OBJECTS
